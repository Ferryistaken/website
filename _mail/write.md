Keep writing.

In a year, I will open my journal. Random page. 

    \ Piani per San Antonio
    \  
    \ - Leggi piu' latino
    \ ...

I will think about this time. This time of lazy idleness, in which I am able to finish my class workload in a few hours. In which I can think and write for multiple hours a day.

It might remind me of what place I'm at in the Count of Montecristo. It will remind me of the novel as a whole. I will forever associate Edmon's revenge with thinking about writing machine learning models for this company.

My kids will enjoy it even more. I know I enjoy it.
