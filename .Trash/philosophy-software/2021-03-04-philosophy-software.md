## Terms used in this post
- Free ➜ Free doesn't mean free of charge, rather Free in a less materialistic way.
- Free Software ➜ Free Software as described by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
- Open Source Software ➜ Software whose source code is available

# Software
- I believe in open source software, which doesn't have to be _free software_(as in how the [FSF](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) describes it). But to guarantee user freedom **every piece of code that runs on you pc must be public**.
- Why not Free Software then?
    - In a perfect world every software would fall under the category of free software, and while the idea of this perfect world is really appealing we need to acknowledge that we live in an imperfect world, where some companies might want their software to be ran only by people who bought the license, or maybe they don't want other people to change their software, and I think that leaving that choice to the developers is a good compromise between privacy and applicability in the real world from a commercial standpoint.
    - While the "[4 essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#the-four-essential-freedoms)" don't directly specify that the software must be free, they do specify that anyone should have _"The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2)."_. Which could create a grey area regarding paid/subscription based software, where in some cases redistributing the software to anyone could be a problem. This doesn't apply to all paid/subscription based software, for example, Netflix could make the desktop/mobile client Open Source, while still keeping a subscription model, since in order to actually watch the content you need an account.
