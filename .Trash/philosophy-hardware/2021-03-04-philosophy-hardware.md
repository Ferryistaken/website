## Terms used in this post
- Free ➜ Free doesn't mean free of charge, rather Free in a less materialistic way.
- Free Software ➜ Free Software as described by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
- Open Source Software ➜ Software whose source code is available

# Hardware
- I don't believe that hardware should be open source, **IF** every piece of software running on it _is_, else the company behind the hardware should make the project/schematics freely available, **so that the community can come up with open source alternatives to the proprietary software** without doing/doing less reverse engineering, **which would be legal in some cases**(for example [reverse engineering to guarantee interoperability within computer programs](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201)).

> In the U.S., Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (17 USC § 1201 (f) - Reverse Engineering) specifically states that it is legal to reverse engineer and circumvent the protection to achieve interoperability between computer programs (such as information transfer between applications). Interoperability is defined in paragraph 4 of Section 103(f).

- I find disgusting that 99.9999999% of modern computing hardware has some form of proprietary software on it, ranging from [intel ME](https://www.wired.com/story/intel-management-engine-vulnerabilities-pcs-servers-iot/) to [whole operating systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/). And I really think that this problem(yes it's a problem ) doesn't have enough voice, but I really think that in the next years(2050 MAX) some major company will do something wrong and expose how bad this problem really is(more than Edward Snowden did). **Because since in our society technology rules us, we cannot be free if our technology isn't.** And for some reason, people don't realize this and don't think that this is a real problem.
