I added a "Philosophy" section in the navbar, which is where I will put my ideals, and what I believe in. It would be awesome if you could check it out since it's the most coherent and technology-unrelated section of this blog yet. I will be adding more topics to it and I'll try to keep it at a pretty high level.
**I am completely open to discussion regarding the things that I write there**, so if you have anything to say, please do [here]({{ site.url }}/about/#contact-me).  
Just click [here]({{ site.url }}/philosophy) or up in the navbar to check it out!
