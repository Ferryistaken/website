# Things that you should keep in mind while browsing this site:
- I am completely open to criticism regarding everything that I post/say (you can contact me [here](https://www.ferry.ml/about/#contact-me)). Keep in mind that am open to criticism, _not insults_, but if you have some really good insults still [email](https://www.ferry.ml/about/#contact-me) them to me.
- This blog is not for posting things that I think people could find useful, it's more of a `/var/log` of what I do. It just happens to be on the World Wide Web, so you might find posts regarding many topics, not just technology, and some of them might just be guides that I upload just to know where to go if I encounter a certain problem again.
- Don't call my a _hypocrite_, simply because I had a different point of view a long time ago. My opinion changes, and I don't feel the obligation to change/delete/censor my old posts because I think that seeing someone's development through time is very interesting, if not important. Since I am quite young my opinion about things can change pretty drastically in a relatively short amount of time. If I say/do things that could be considered hypocritical *on the same blog post/in a very short amount of time*, **call me out on that**.
- **Don't take what I say as the truth**. I have no real degree in the IT field, everything I know amounts to what I learned over the years on the internet (forums, guides, documentation, IRC, etc.). I am not responsible if you mess something up while following a guide/everything else on this blog it's not my fault.  
**This should be something you always keep in mind while browsing/following guides on the internet.**
