At Egicon S.r.l., a company renowned for crafting high-performance "Plug & Play" electronic solutions, I showcased my expertise in firmware development. I was instrumental in developing bare-metal software for custom hardware, facilitating seamless product testing and ensuring the project's longevity through the utilization of industry-standard technology stacks. Collaborating with remote teams to refine the project based on senior developer feedback was a testament to my team coordination skills.
