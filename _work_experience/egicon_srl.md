At **Egicon S.r.l.**, a company known for manufacturing high-performance "Plug & Play" electronic solutions, I was able to showcase my skills in **firmware development**.

I was tasked with developing **bare-metal software** for **custom hardware**, facilitating seamless product testing and ensuring the project's longevity through the utilization of **industry-standard technology stacks** such as [ModBus](https://modbus.org/).

A writeup of my project was written by a lead engineer at Egicon and is available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/usb-16-reed-relays-programmable-massimo-poletti/)
