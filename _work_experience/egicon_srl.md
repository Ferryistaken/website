At Egicon S.r.l., a company known for crafting high-performance "Plug & Play" electronic solutions, I had the chance to hone my skills in firmware development. I participated in the development of bare-metal software for custom hardware, assisting in product testing and helping to ensure the project's longevity through the application of industry-standard technology stacks. Working with remote teams to refine the project based on senior developer feedback allowed me to improve my team coordination skills.
