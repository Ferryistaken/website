At **Egicon S.r.l.**, a company renowned for crafting high-performance "Plug & Play" electronic solutions, I showcased my expertise in **firmware development**.

I was instrumental in developing **bare-metal software** for **custom hardware**, facilitating seamless product testing for **sportsbike testing** and ensuring the project's longevity through the utilization of **industry-standard technology stacks** such as [ModBus](https://modbus.org/).

I also collaborated with remote teams to refine the project based on senior developer feedback and sharpened my team coordination skills.
