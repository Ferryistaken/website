During my experience at **Rocky Linux**--the successor of CentOS--I was fortunate to be part of a community-driven effort to develop a free, enterprise-grade operating system. 
Collaborating with a global team, I was able to contribute to the project's growth from a small group to a vibrant community of thousands.

I remember joining a call with the CEO, Gregory Kurtzer, where less than 20 people were present, in which he outlined his vision for the project.

My efforts in learning to use tools like **Bugzilla** and **Mattermost** aided in effective tracking and communication, which were vital in maintaining the project's quality and success.

Now Rocky Linux is a viable enterprise grade distro, which as of September 2024 is **the most used enterprise Linux distribution** ([source](https://linuxiac.com/rocky-linux-is-the-most-preferred-enterprise-linux-distribution)) with around **half a million instances**.

I wrote about my experience with Rocky in a [short blog post]({{ site.url}}/my-biggest-open-source-achievement-yet/).
