During my experience at Rocky Linux--the successor of CentOS--I was fortunate to be part of a community-driven effort to develop a free, enterprise-grade operating system. Collaborating with a global team, I was able to contribute to the project's growth from a small group to a vibrant community of thousands. My efforts in learning to use tools like Bugzilla and Mattermost aided in effective tracking and communication, which were vital in maintaining the project's quality and success.
