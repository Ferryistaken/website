During my time at Rocky Linux, the successor to CentOS, I became a key player in the community-driven effort to develop a free, enterprise-grade operating system. Working with a global team, I helped the project grow from a 20-person team to a thriving community of thousands. My adept use of tools like Bugzilla and Mattermost facilitated effective tracking and communication, which were crucial in ensuring the project's quality and success.
