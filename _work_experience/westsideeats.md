At WestSideEats, a New York-based nonprofit startup specializing in food deliveries, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development and optimization of internal tools. By learning and applying agile methodologies and technologies such as React and AWS, I was able to assist in expediting development timelines and facilitating client outsourcing for menu management. My growing familiarity with tools like Git and Jira was beneficial in fostering smooth team collaboration and project progression.
