At **WestSideEats**, a **New York**-based nonprofit startup specializing in food deliveries, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development and optimization of internal tools.

By learning and applying **agile** methodologies and cutting edge webdev technologies such as React and AWS, I was able to lead the cutting of development timelines and facilitating client outsourcing for menu management.

My growing familiarity with tools like **Git** and **Jira** was beneficial in fostering smooth team collaboration and project progression.

**In simple words:** I made it so that an engineer's precious time didn't have to be wasted translating menu's from the restaurant's format to our format.
