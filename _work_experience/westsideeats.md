At WestSideEats, a New York-based nonprofit startup specializing in food deliveries, I made significant contributions to the development and optimization of internal tools. Utilizing agile methodologies and technologies such as React and AWS, I played a vital role in expediting development timelines and facilitating client outsourcing for menu management. My proficiency with tools like Git and Jira ensured smooth team collaboration and project progression.
