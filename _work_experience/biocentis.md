At Biocentis, a pioneering agrotech firm specializing in vector pest control through genetic engineering, I played a crucial role in revolutionizing simulation processes. I spearheaded the development of a GPU Agent-Based Model to accurately represent the swarm flight patterns of Drosophila Suzukii, drastically reducing simulation time from 8 hours to just 3 minutes. My adept handling of GPU C++ algorithms and consistent updates to the international team were pivotal in the project's success.
