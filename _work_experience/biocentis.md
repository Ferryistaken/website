At Biocentis, a pioneering agrotech firm specializing in vector pest control through genetic engineering, I was given the responsibility to contribute to the revolutionizing of simulation processes. I was involved in the development of a GPU Agent-Based Model to more accurately represent the swarm flight patterns of Drosophila Suzukii, which helped in reducing simulation time from hours to a few minutes. My dedication to mastering GPU C++ algorithms and my commitment to fostering open and regular communication with the international team were valuable in steering the project towards success.
