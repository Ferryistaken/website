At Biocentis, a pioneering **agrotech** firm specializing in **vector pest control** through **genetic engineering**, I was given the responsibility to contribute to the revolutionizing of simulation processes. I was involved in the development of a **GPU Agent-Based Model** to more accurately represent the swarm flight patterns of *Drosophila Suzukii*.

During my time, I brought the Agent Based Simulator's execution time **from 8 hours** in the Python simulator **to just over 3 minutes** with the C++ algorithm.

I was also able to present my work in **daily** and **monthly global meetings** with the rest of the team, developing my **public speaking** and result-reporting skills.
