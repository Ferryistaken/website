Western music. 12 Notes. 7 Natural notes.

Fixed Do Solfege, taught in the majority of Europe, fixed a particular frequency to *Do*. *Do* is the same frequency as the american *C*.

Does this make a lot of sense? In my opinion, no. Why would you do that to yourself? We already have names for notes (alphabet letters or numbers).

However the piano is made around this fixed Do system. It is layed out and tuned around the key of C. Aroudn the violin/treble cleff. The staff is modeled around this as well. With treble cleff, there are no sharps and flats on the staff. Only natural notes. You can add flats, but there is no space for them. A *D* and a *D sharp* are at the same height.
