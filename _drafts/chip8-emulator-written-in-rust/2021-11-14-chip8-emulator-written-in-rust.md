# ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§ Come back soon.

In this brief writeup, I'll show you how I wrote my first emulator--an emulator to the CHIP-8 programming language--in Rust.

# Introduction

This post isn't supposed to be a step-to-step guide, it may be treated as such, but you will probably find some better guides on the internet. I wrote this emulator a while ago and am just now(~1.5 years later) writing this post, so don't lynch me for my errors--or better yet; fix them on [github](https://github.com/Ferryistaken/CHIP8-rs/issues).
