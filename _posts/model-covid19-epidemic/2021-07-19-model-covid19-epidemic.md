# Data science for epidemic investigation and modeling

I recently grew an interest in data science and artificial intelligence, and *we are still in a pandemic* (although hopefully at the end, fingers crossed for the [Delta Variant](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/5-things-to-know-delta-variant-covid)), so I chose to test out some models to work with data from Covid-19.

## Tools used

Here are the tools that I used:

- **R:** R is a programming language used for statistical computing and graphics. The industry standard in the [FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) scene.
- **covid19.analytics:** [This](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covid19.analytics/index.html) is an R package to pull data from the [John Hopkins Center for System Science and Engineering (CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This source publishes data with a delay of **just one day**. Although they changed the structure of the data [a few times](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/3464), it's very usable and mostly reliable.
- **dygraphs:** [This](https://dygraphs.com/) is another R package that is worth mentioning if you are doing anything in Jupyter (or even in RStudio). Instead of outputting graphs as images, **it generates html and javascript graphs.**
- **Jupyterlab:** JupyterLab is a "web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data."[^1]

## My setup

By using those tools I can come up with a setup like this:

### The editor
[![Jupyterlab Setup](/assets/posts/model-covid19-epidemic/jupyterlab-setup.png)](/assets/posts/model-covid19-epidemic/jupyterlab-setup.png)
> I generally use the light theme for visibility of the graphs, here I used the dark theme because it looks better in screenshots.

### Dynamic graphs with `dygraph`:
[![Dygraph showcase](/assets/posts/model-covid19-epidemic/dygraph-showcase.gif)](/assets/posts/model-covid19-epidemic/dygraph-showcase.gif)
> Using this library, we can produce graphs that react depending on cursor events.

## Data

The data comes from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.

Here's how the data is structured:
[![Data](/assets/posts/model-covid19-epidemic/data-structure.png)](/assets/posts/model-covid19-epidemic/data-structure.png)

Each **row** is a **country/province**, while each **column** after column 4 is a **day**. This specific screenshot is taken from the confirmed cases csv file.

We can easily pull this data using the `covid19.analysis` package described above.

```r
# reads time series data
all_confirmed_cases <- covid19.data("ts-confirmed")
all_confirmed_deaths <- covid19.data("ts-deaths")
all_confirmed_recoveries <- covid19.data("ts-recovered")
```

### Data manipulation

We can easily build a cell to manipulate this data:

```r
indexList <- c()
countryList <- c()

# Get all rows
for (i in rownames(all_confirmed_cases)) {
    # print(c(i, all_confirmed_cases[i, 2]))
    indexList <- c(indexList, i)
    countryList <- c(countryList, all_confirmed_cases[i, 2])
}

country_index_list <- as.data.frame(cbind(indexList, countryList))

country_index_list[154, ]

# We can see that Italy is index 154, so we are going to  use that
italy_index <- 154
```

After this, we'll just extract the relevant rows.

```r
it_confirmed_cases <- all_confirmed_cases[italy_index, ]
it_confirmed_deaths <- all_confirmed_deaths[italy_index, ]
it_confirmed_recoveries <- all_confirmed_recoveries[italy_index, ]

print("Cases:")
View(it_confirmed_cases)
print("Deaths:")
View(it_confirmed_deaths)
print("Recoveries:")
View(it_confirmed_recoveries)

firstCaseDate <- "2020-01-31"
```

We will also need the day of the first case, and we will use that as Day 0 for our models.

```r
# Find index of first case
firstInfection <- 0

for (i in 1:ncol(it_confirmed_cases)) {
    if (class(it_confirmed_cases[, i]) == 'integer' && it_confirmed_cases[, i] >= 1) {
        print(paste0("Index of the first infection is: ", i, ", Number of infections is: ", it_confirmed_cases[, i]))
        
        firstInfection <- it_confirmed_cases[, i]
        
        break
    }
}
```

## Analysis

Let's proceed to analyse this data.

First let's define some model-agnostic variables, such as the time frame.

```r
# Days that I'm analyzing
analysis_days <- 365

# Date list
dates <- seq(as.Date(firstCaseDate), by = "days", length.out = analysis_days)
```

### Used Models

#### SIR Model

The [SIR](https://www.google.com/search?q=Sir+model+&sxsrf=ALeKk01PRPAIyua2TQjDfzCI2NbxVzoFZg%3A1626715569589&ei=sbX1YLGiI7Cw5NoPweermAQ&oq=Sir+model+&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECcyBAgjECcyBAgjECcyBQgAEJECMgUIABCLAzIFCAAQiwMyBQgAEIsDMgUIABCLAzIFCAAQiwMyBQgAEIsDOgYIABAWEB46BQgAEIYDOgIIADoHCAAQhwIQFEoECEEYAFDjDFi6EGCXE2gAcAJ4AIABbIgBuQKSAQMzLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6uAEBwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjxvrPd0-_xAhUwGFkFHcHzCkMQ4dUDCA4&uact=5#wptab=s:H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3qDAoTq8wfcRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uJC08exiknRNKU1OLMnMz0vMcc7PS04tKHHLL8otzUlcxKqTnJ9bkFhUkpuaV5KYo5Cbn5KaU6yQmaeQWpCZkpqbmZ-Tn16pkAZRDgClBW2QkQAAAA) is one of the simplest [compartmental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) used in epidemiology. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model), but simply put, the SIR model divides the population in 3 categories:

- **S**usceptible
- **I**nfected
- **R**ecovered (or dead)
- **N** = the whole population, $$S + I + R$$

[![SIR Model Graph](https://covid19.uclaml.org/figures/sir_illu.png)](https://covid19.uclaml.org/figures/sir_illu.png)

##### The Math Behind the Model

<br>

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{dS}{dt} & = & - \frac{\beta S I}{N} \\
	\frac{dI}{dt} & = & \frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I \\
	\frac{dR}{dt} & = & \gamma I \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<br>

It can be described by these 3 differential equations, which will show the relations between the Susceptible $$S(t)$$, Infected $$I(t)$$ and Recovered $$R(t)$$ as functions of time.

There are also two parameters, $$\beta$$ and $$\gamma$$, where beta is the **effective transmission rate**, and gamma is the **effective recovery rate**. We can use these two parameters to obtain $$R_0$$, which some of you may have heard if you followed the news.

$$
R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
$$

##### The Code for the Model

Now that we know the math behind the model, we can code it in R.

```r
susceptible <- 60e+06 # Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/786485/population-by-gender-in-italy/#:~:text=Population%20in%20Italy%20in%202020%2C%20by%20gender&text=As%20of%20January%202020%2C%2060.2,roughly%2016%20million%20people%20lived.
infected <- firstInfection
recovered <- 0

initial_state_values = c(S = susceptible, I = infected, R = recovered)

# Parameters
# The beta for covid is estimated to be ranging from 1.5 to 6.68. With median of 2.79. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7751056/#:~:text=R0%20of%20COVID%2D19,-R0%20of&text=compared%2012%20studies%20published%20from,an%20interquartile%20range%20of%201.16.
# We can simulate this scenario by having our beta as 0.27 and our gamma as 0.1 
parameters = c(gamma = 0.1, beta = 0.27)

# Time points
time = seq(from = 1,to = analysis_days, by = 1)

# SIR model function 
sir_model <- function(time,state,parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state,parameters)),{
    N = S + I + R
    lambda = beta*(I/N) 
    dS =- lambda*S
    dI = lambda*S - gamma*I
    dR = gamma*I
    
    return(list(c(dS,dI,dR)))
  }
  )
}

#Solving the differential equations
output <- as.data.frame(ode(y = initial_state_values, func = sir_model, parms = parameters, times = time))

out_long = melt(output , id = "time")

colnames(out_long) <- c("Time", "Variable", "Value")
```

##### Visualization

And let's graph the model's output.

```r
Susceptible <- out_long[1:analysis_days, 3]
Infected <- out_long[(analysis_days + 1):(analysis_days*2), 3]
Recovered <- out_long[(analysis_days*2 + 1):(analysis_days*3), 3]

plot_data <- as.data.frame(cbind(Susceptible/1000000, Infected/1000000, Recovered/1000000))
colnames(plot_data) <- c("Susceptbile", "Infected", "Recovered")
rownames(plot_data) <- dates

plot_data <- as.xts(plot_data)

# head(plot_data)

dygraph(plot_data) %>%
    dyAxis("y", label = "People (Millions)") %>%
    dyAxis("x", label = "Date")
```

#### SEIR Model

The [SEIR]() model is an expansion on the SIR model. The E stands for **Exposed.** An exposed person is a person that was exposed to the virus, but isn't **Infectious** yet.

- **E**xposed: someone who was infected but can't spread the virus *yet*.
- **N** = total population. This time $$N = S + E + I + R$$.

##### The Math Behind the Model

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{dS}{dt} & = & - \frac{\beta S I}{N} \\
	\frac{dE}{dt} & = & \frac{\beta S i }{N} - \delta E \\
	\frac{dI}{dt} & = & \delta E - \gamma I \\
	\frac{dR}{dt} & = & \gamma I \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$
