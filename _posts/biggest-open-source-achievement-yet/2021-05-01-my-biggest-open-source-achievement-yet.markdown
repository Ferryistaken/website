# Contributing to Rocky Linux in the right way

Since IBM [killed CentOS](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux), a bunch of new distros popped up to fill in the gap left by CentOS, a free and open source linux distro catered for enterprise usage on the server. I took interest in [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org), since it was created by the original founder of CentOS, Gregory Kurtzer(_we are basically best friends on Mattermost now_).

When they released their first release candidate yesterday, April 30 2021, we all began testing it. Soon enough, `@jorp` on mattermost started a contest, and decided to award someone a unique badge on the [rocky linux forums](https://forum.rockylinux.org) to whoever was the first one to spin up a Minecraft server on the latest Rocky Linux release. Sure enough, I won the prize, with a time of _just_ 10 minutes, from when `@jorp` announced the race to when I got the mc server running.

### And just like that, I got my [unique forum badge](https://forums.rockylinux.org/badges/105/first-minecraft-server-on-rocky-linux).
