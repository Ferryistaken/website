# Food
### In this section I will talk about food, more specifically, the best diet for the modern member of society

#### Problems with modern diets
- If you spend a good amount of time on the internet, you probably saw some very disturbing videos about how animals are treated in [factory farms](https://sentientmedia.org/factory-farming/). They are truly horrifying and some of them are really enough to make the watcher have second thoughts about ever eating meat again. Even if you have never seen this videos, you probably have heard of animal cruelty in the current industry, maybe you just don't care, or maybe you just choose to ignore it. I'm not judging and I'm not writing this to make you change your diet(mostly because I know from experience that people don't make such radical changes based on a random article they found on the internet), but just to share my thoughts about the subject, which _may_ make you think about what you eat a bit more.  
- I don't think that to solve the problem of animal cruelty in farms we should all go vegan/vegetarian or any other of those diets which radically change your eating habits because:
    1.  They are just too much of a change for them to be feasible as a long term solution. Most people don't have the dedication to keep being vegan/vegetarian. Most vegetarian/vegan people in fact pick up those diets because it makes them feel different, and better than other people, which is sadly a very sought after feeling in our society.  
    2. Eating meat is in our nature, and a lot of other animals eat meat too. Not eating meat would be like solving climate change by stopping every factory in the world. ***It's just not an healthy solution.***
- The next rational question would be, ***So what is the solution?***
- Personally, I think that the solution is having a diet which in some way _reduces_ your meat intake, while not affecting your protein intake.
> I think that the solution is having a diet which in some way _reduces_ your meat intake.
- This could consist in only eating meat once, or twice a week, or a month, or maybe trying to always buy meat which has been harvested in a humane farm, _but where is the fun/philosofical meaning behind that?_

#### My Solution

- The diet that I think a lot of people should think about adopting is the following: **You only eat what you could kill.** 
- At first this seems unfair, people who are weaker cannot eat as much, but here we aren't talking about killing in the practical sense. What I mean by what you could kill is **what you could ethically kill, without feeling any regret, or with low enough regret where the satisfaction which will come from the meal will make killing the animal ok.** 
- Another thing that we keep in mind is: you aren't killing the animal because you have no other choice, you are purposefully killing him just to get some food. To make decisions with this diet easier picture this: You own a farm with every animal and plant on the planet, you have a personal cook which is able to cook everything on this planet with one condition: you need to bring him the raw food. Every morning you wake up, go around your farm, and choose what you will personally kill. The only thing that you should think about while making that decision is the worth of the animal's life, not if you would be in danger by attacking him, or if it's an endangered species. It's only an evaluation of the life on another living being.
- As you can already tell (if you are thinking about what you would be able to eat in this diet), this diet makes you think about your ethics before every meal.
- Personally, I couldn't kill a pig unless I was in a very desperate situation. If I had a farm with every animal and plant in the world, I would mostly eat plants(beans and other protein rich plants to make up for the loss of the meat), fish, and chickens.
- By following this simple rule: **Only Eat What You Could Kill**, we would greatly reduce how much meat we consume, while at the same time sensibilizing the average Joe about animal cruelty. *Two birds with one stone.*
