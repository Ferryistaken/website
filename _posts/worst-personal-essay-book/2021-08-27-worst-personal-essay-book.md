I've decided to start this new "series" on my blog: *Procrastination Tales*. Trust me, this totally won't join all the other series in the "it's a series but only had episode #1" pile.

In these posts I will document all the strange, useless, futile, but extremely interesting(for me at least) discussions that I have with my friends about mundane topics, analyzed from an analytical point of view.

Today I will cover the following topic:

# What would happen if we came up with a yearly collection of the weirdest, worst, most particular, interesting personal essays submitted each year to colleges?

While I was finding things to do to procrastinate the writing of my Mathematical Internal Assessment, I had a strange conversation with a friend of mine. For the purpose of this article, we'll call him **Randall** (Thanks [to this random name generator](https://www.name-generator.org.uk/?i=2hyvavea) for this awesome prompt).

## The Genesis

Me and Randall were talking about our personal essays, since we'll be seniors this year. Our conversation went roughly like this:

```
> at what point are you with your personal essay?

> really far from finishing it

> same

> how much bs do you think that gets submitted every year to colleges?

> probably a lot, the other day I read a couple essays that made me cry

> wait a second
```

And this is exactly where we started putting way too much effort into something so worthless. Something that we do more than I'd like to admit. And I'm here to stop this, it won't be worthless anymore if I write it on my website ... right?

## Open the browser tabs and start the calculators, we're going on an adventure!

We found out that according to [this government site](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372#:~:text=About%203.7%20million%20students%20are,enrollment%20compare%20with%20years%20past%3F), **3.7 million students** graduate from highschool each year in the US. Then we saw that according to [this other government site](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/hsgec.nr0.htm), only **62% enrolls in college**.

This means that about **2.5 million students** have to write a personal essay *each year*.

Usually this is where you stop and get back to work, instead,

### This is where we started putting *more* effort into it.

Top colleges only accept **8% of applicants**. We'll assume that the 8% that gets accepted writes very good personal essays, I mean, we are talking about Columbia, Berkeley and MIT students here. We are also going to assume that the people who apply to one of those colleges also applies to the others. This leaves us with about **92%** of the remaining students not accepted, or, about **2.2 million students**.

Let's say that there is another **20% of students** that are just as talented and hard working as the 8% who got accepted, that simply didn't. *(This is a very conservative assumption, personally I think that it's closer to 10%)* Since they are just as talented, we are going to remove this next 20% from the population.

This leaves us with just 1.8 million students. We'll also assume that the people who go to study outside the US balance out the people applying to US colleges from foreign countries, which isn't true, just to keep it conservative.

This leaves us with **1.8 million mediocre personal essays**, *each year*. Let's assume that **10%** of these essays are only read by the kid who writes them, I know what you might be thinking: "It's probably way higher than that. What is this guy he saying?". But let's keep it conservative.

### What does this mean?

This means that each year there are **180 thousands** personal essays submitted to colleges, checked only by the person who wrote it. And mind you, this hypothetical person is far from the top 28% of student. According to the [2020 SAT Score report](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/understanding-sat-scores.pdf), this means that, statistically, if he was the guy just shy of the "top" 28%, he got 1130 on the SAT. If he was on the bottom 30% percent, he probably got 920.

> Clarification: I know how controversial SAT scores are, and why Universities are refusing to accept them. I'm not trying to make a social statement. This whole post is just to have a good laugh and nothing should be taken seriously. I'm just interpreting data in a comical way.

Now let's say that **1%** of this **10%** is very well written, but just wasn't appropriate for Universities. Maybe it wasn't even intended for Universities. All we know is that this 1% contains extremely well written personal essays by misunderstood geniuses.

Now let's say that there was some way of anonymously collecting and reading these **1800** personal essays. A personal essay on average has 500 words, which means reading **900000 words** each year.

According to [this website](https://www.megcabot.com/about-meg-cabot/frequently-asked-questions-getting-published/#:~:text=Most%20adult%20books%20are%20about,250%2D300%20words%20per%20page.) the average adult book contains **90000** words, which means that all these essays are about as long as **10 books**.
Now let's say that you had a relatively high reading speed. I took [this test](http://www.readingsoft.com/), and by putting into practice some speed reading tactics, I got **522 wpm**, a relatively high reading speed.

If I managed to keep up with this speed for all the essays, it would take me a bit shy of **29 hours**. Mind you, we are not keeping in consideration that these "bottom" essays may be shorter than average.

## Creating a Best Seller From other People's trash

You know what they say, ***One man's trash is another man's treasure***, let's say that you read through these essays, and extrapolated the top 200, this will leave you with a **100000 words** book, just over average, which contains the best personal presentations of america's young writers.

And mind you, you could publish this book *every year*. You could even do 10 Year specials with the top story from each year. You can thank me later, after you become a New York Times best selling author, since it seems to me like they let anyone be a best selling author now, and this book will have just the right content.

> It's just a joke of course, I wish I could become a NY Times best selling author
