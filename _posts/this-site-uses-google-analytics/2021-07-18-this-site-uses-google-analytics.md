# ⚠️ THIS SITE NOW USES GOOGLE ANALYTICS ⚠️

## Why did I choose to include google analytics?

You may know that I'm quite big into privacy, what I am not into is conspiracy theories. I **do** think that Google is quite literally the devil, yet, I chose to add google analytics to this website.

Why? You may ask. Well, the TLDR is: **Hate the game, not the player.**

I do think that all tracking is bad, and that no one should be tracked, but the responsibility to not be tracked relies mostly on the user, in this case you. I personally use a combination of [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/), the [Brave Browser](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) and [Ublock origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) (as well as [many other extensions.](https://privacytools.io/browsers/#addons)) to avoid being tracked by websites. **You should do the same.** And I will post a guide in the future on how to increase your internet privacy while not going into conspiracy theory territory.

## Is the responsibility to avoid tracking *always* in the hands of the user?

Of course not! No website/app/anything else should ***block*** a service if tracking isn't present. **You can still use my website while avoiding tracking by using just one of the solutions above.**

I just chose to add tracking to gain some cool data about the users of this website. It doesn't mean that you can't use it without tracking. Heck, you can even use my website while blocking all javascript and css, I would never do that.

I even suggest that you endorse some of these solutions, and that you **block tracking on your browser. Please try to block tracking, even on this website.**
