# Pascal's Wager
Pascal's wager is an argument which Pascal makes, in which he says that no rational person would choose to not believe in God, even if God in the end didn't exist. In this paper I will point out the fallacies in his wager, and also create an atheist wager which uses some of the same fallacies to make it seem like the only possible rational choice would be not believing in God.

#### Specs
The paper is written in latex using `documentclass` `article`.

*Consider Pascal's "Wager on God" and its implication on the d    ecision of believing in God, try to delineate the elements of a coun    terargument. Can we envision a bet on atheism? How would we structur    e it? Could we claim atheism is the reasonable choice?*
