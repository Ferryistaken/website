## What is Rofi?

In this writeup I'm going to talk about [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi), from their github, "a window switcher, Application launcher and dmenu replacement".  
Most people just use rofi as an application launcher, but the default theme looks like it came straight from 2011.  
These are 2 themes that I hand picked from _the internet_ over the years, which I think are the best ones that I found so far.

[Rofi-Glass](https://gist.github.com/Ferryistaken/e0cf8e0850ae386d33580aa191b4ebad#file-rofi-glass-fullscreen-rasi) is a rofi theme which aims to be clean and minimal, to disrupt the thought that linux window manager setups can't look modern.  
When used, you can only see your current background and the rofi prompt, _nothing else_, this makes for a very modern design which brings no distractions to the desktop

# Rofi Sidetab

[Rofi-Sidetab](https://gist.github.com/Ferryistaken/e0cf8e0850ae386d33580aa191b4ebad#file-sidetab-rasi) is a rofi theme which is singular in the sense that it works as a sidetab, this makes it feel more integrated with the desktop. On top of that it has 3 tabs on the bottom, which make you choose between Window(as in windows switcher), Run and Ssh.
