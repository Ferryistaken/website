# Book Review: _"The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness"_ by Morgan Housel

> Or, how I stopped worrying and figured out that I would become financially independent from the age of 17

## Introduction
Like every other normal(I hope so) 17 year old, I have always felt the dreading sensation that capitalism was going to make my life miserable and that I was never going to accomplish anything sensational before I died, this was before I took my personal finance seriously and I started to make capitalism work for me.

To do so, I started learning how to manage my money, invest it, preserve it, and not be a wage slave and hate my life by the time I'm 25 (hopefully, I'm not there yet but I'll keep you updated).  
I know how lucky I am to have the privilege of learning all this things at such a young age, and so I decided to get as much as possible from this opportunity that I have.

## Quotes
This was one of the most recommended books by people who I look highly upon in this sector, and rigthly so, just to give you an idea of what kind of book it is, here are some quotes:

> “Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.”
> ― Morgan Housel, The Psychology of Money

> “Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.”
> ― Morgan Housel, The Psychology of Money

> “Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.”
> ― Morgan Housel, The Psychology of Money

## Themes
This book covers everything from managing money, to investments, to stress management and even acknowledging the power of luck in our lifes. It is in some sense similar to Jeff Olson's [The Slight Edge](https://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Happiness/dp/1626340463), but way more concrete. (Being too abstract is one of my biggest criticisms of that book).

### Compound Interest
The biggest takeaway from this book is probably the power of compound interest,

I'm sorry but if this graph doesn't make your mouth water you are beyond salvation, nothing more can be done anymore.

Housel's emphasys on breaking money in simple steps is vital to the readibility and fluidity of this book. It doesn't throw around big words just for the sake of it. It makes managing money by showing you the most important factors involved: time, risk, luck, and brain.

## Overall: Would Recommend

I rated this book a 5 star on [my goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139253581-alessandro-ferrari). I really thing that it's a masterpiece in the personal finance space.
