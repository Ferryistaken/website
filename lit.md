## Horace, Odes Book 1, Poem 11

<center>
Tu ne quaesieris (scire nefas) quem mihi, quem tibi<br>
finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios<br>
temptaris numeros. Ut melius quicquid erit pati<br>
Seu pluris hiemes seu tribuit Iuppiter ultimam,<br>
quae nunc oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare<br>
Tyrrhenum, sapias, vina liques et spatio brevi<br>
spem longam reseces. Dum loquimur, fugerit invida<br>
aetas: carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.<br>
</center>

### Translation

You should not ask – to know is a sin – which end<br>
the gods have given to me, or to you, Leuconoe, nor<br>
should you meddle with Babylonian calculations. How much better to suffer<br>
whatever will be, whether Jupiter gives us more winters, or whether this is our last,<br>
which now weakens the Tyrrhenian sea on the pumice stones<br>
opposing it. Be wise, strain the wine, and cut back long hope<br>
into a small space. While we talk, envious time will<br>
have fled: pluck the day, trusting as little as possible to the future.<br>
