I am Alessandro Ferrari, a **software engineer** with a specialization in **bioinformatics**, currently advancing my studies at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. My professional background encompasses roles at [Biocentis](/work_experience/biocentis/) in **Milan** and [WestSideEats](/work_experience/westsideeats/) in **New York**, where I have contributed to significant advancements in technology development. In the early stages of my career, I had the privilege to be part of the duo that secured a **first-place** finish at the 2015 RomeCup robotics competition. I am also actively involved in innovative **immuno-transcriptomics** research at Georgia Tech's [Gibson Lab](https://ggibsongt.wixsite.com/gibsongatech). I welcome the opportunity for collaboration; please connect with me on [LinkedIn]({{ page.link2 }}) or at [alessandroferrari@gatech.edu](mailto:alessandroferrari@gatech.edu).
