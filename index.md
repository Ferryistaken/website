# About Me

I am Alessandro Ferrari, a **software engineer** with a minor in **biology**, currently advancing my studies at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

My professional background encompasses roles at [Biocentis](/work_experience/biocentis/) in **Milan** and [WestSideEats](/work_experience/westsideeats/) in **New York**, where I have contributed to significant advancements in technology development. In the early stages of my development, I had the privilege to be part of the duo that secured a **first-place** finish at the 2015 RomeCup robotics competition.

I am also actively involved in cutting-edge **immuno-transcriptomics** research at Georgia Tech's **[Gibson Lab](https://ggibsongt.wixsite.com/gibsongatech)**. I welcome the opportunity for collaboration; please connect with me on [LinkedIn]({{ page.link2 }}) or at ***[alessandroferrari@gatech.edu](mailto:alessandroferrari@gatech.edu)***.

# Current Work


I'm currently doing **immuno transcriptomics** research at the Gibson lab. My work mainly consists of developing and applying **bioinformatics pipelines** and **machine learning models** to predict ***scRNA-seq*** data based on ***scATAC-seq*** and **GWAS** data in healthy and Crohn's disease patients.

By applying a **computer science-centric** methodology to bioinformatics, I'm enhancing efficiency by **automating processes** that are traditionally hand-coded.
